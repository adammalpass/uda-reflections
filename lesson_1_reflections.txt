Use the following command to make a diff:

diff -u <old_file> <new_file>
git log --stat
git diff <old_file> <new_file>

In the git log the newest changes are shown first (reverse chronological order.)

Use the following command to create new git repositry:
git init

The following command shows status of repository:
git status

Git doesn`t automatically check-in everything when you run `git commit`. First you must add any files to be committed to the `Staging Area`. This is done by:
git add <file name>

Check which files are in staging area through `git status` as before.

To compare working directory to staging area:
git diff

To compare staging area to most recent commit in repository:
git diff --staged

To revert all changes in working area and staging area (***CAREFUL - NON REVERSIBLE***)
git reset --hard

To view current branch (and available brances):
git branch

To create new branch
git branch <branch name>

To create new branch and check it out all in one go:
git checkout -b <branch name>

To merge 2 branches
git merge <branch1> <branch2>

After error, to revert to state before attempting to merge:
git merge --abort

To connect to remote repository (e.g. Github)
git remote add origin <link>

To copy data to repository:
git push origin <branch name>

To update data from repository:
git pull origin <branch name>

To update local copy of remote repository (origin/master). Use this to check for/merge conflicts before pushing.
git fetch

To add copy of origin git to your forked database:
git remote add upstream <link>
