Use the following command to make a diff:

diff -u <old_file> <new_file>
git log --stat
git diff <old_file> <new_file>

In the git log the newest changes are shown first (reverse chronological order.)

Use the following command to create new git repositry:
git init

The following command shows status of repository:
git status

Git doesn`t automatically check-in everything when you run `git commit`. First you must add any files to be committed to the `Staging Area`. This is done by:
git add <file name>

Check which files are in staging area through `git status` as before.
